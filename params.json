{"name":"DynamicXray","tagline":"UIKit Dynamics runtime visualisation and introspection library for iOS.","body":"### DynamicXray\r\n\r\nDynamicXray is a UIKit Dynamics runtime visualisation and introspection library.\r\n\r\nEver wanted to see under the hood of the UIKit Dynamics physics engine?\r\nNow you can! With DynamicXray you can visualise your dynamic animator live at\r\nruntime, exposing all dynamic behaviours and dynamic items.\r\n\r\nDynamicXray includes a suite of UIKit Dynamics demonstrations in a universal iOS app:\r\nDynamicXrayCatalog. All of the demos allow DynamicXray introspection to be enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nOpen DynamicXray.xcworkspace, select the Framework scheme, build the framework.\r\n\r\nIf successful, a Finder window should open at the location of the DynamicXray.framework.\r\n\r\nAdd DynamicXray.framework to your iOS project.\r\n\r\nIn your code, import the header and add an instance of DynamicXray to your dynamic animator.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#import <DynamicXray/DynamicXray.h>\r\n...\r\nDynamicXray *xray = [[DynamicXray alloc] init];\r\n[self.dynamicAnimator addBehavior:xray];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nDynamicXray is built as a UIDynamicBehavior. This means it can be simply added to any\r\nUIDynamicAnimator to enable the introspection overlay. By default, all behaviours added\r\nto the animator will be visualised.\r\n\r\nFor more control, the DynamicXray behaviour exposes options such as temporarily disabling\r\nthe overlay, adjusting the cross fade between app and overlay, whether to draw dynamic\r\nitem outlines, and more. Refer to the DynamicXray header.\r\n\r\nDynamicXray includes a built-in configuration panel that slides up from the bottom of the\r\nscreen. The configuration panel provides access to some options at runtime. The configuration panel\r\ncan be presented by calling -presentConfigurationViewController.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDynamicXray *xray = [[DynamicXray alloc] init];\r\n[self.dynamicAnimator addBehavior:xray];\r\n[xray presentConfigurationViewController];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## DynamicXrayCatalog\r\n\r\nThe included project DynamicXrayCatalog is a universal iOS app containing a suite\r\nof various UIKit Dynamics demonstrations. The demos include DynamicXray pre-loaded\r\nso introspection can be enabled on any demo to see the inner workings.\r\n\r\nThe demos in DynamicXrayCatalog were created by various authors and all are open\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nSubmit a pull request if you would like to contribute a demo to DynamicXrayCatalog.\r\nPlease make sure that your demo includes an option to enable DynamicXray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nDynamicXray is Copyright (c) Chris Miles 2013-2014 and available for use under a GPL-3.0 license.\r\n\r\nThe DynamicXray icon and any other included artwork is Copyright (c) Chris Miles 2013-2014 and available for use under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License only when used along with the DynamicXray library.\r\n\r\nDynamicXrayCatalog is Copyright (c) Chris Miles 2013-2014 and others.
